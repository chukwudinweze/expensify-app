# Expensify App

Previously, I learnt about React-Router, Redux, React-Redux, momentjs and react-dates all in isolation.

This time around, I used what I learnt in all those mentioned concepts above to create an axpensify app.

1. With Router, the app won't have to reload on navigation from one page to another, it will be handled by javascript.

2. This app will rely on several states in order to work perfectly. This is the reason I used Redux to manage the states of this app. This also helped me build a concrete understanding towards Redux concepts like Reducers, combineReducers, Connect, Store, Dispatch and so on.

3. momentjs and react-dates were used to create and edit dates of expenses creation.
